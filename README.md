# P-20W+ Data Quality Validation Project

## Overview
This data quality validation tool provides states with a centralized repository of SQL-based validation rules that can be customized and implemented across different data environments. The current rules are developed for Ed-Fi Operational Data Store (ODS) and Common Education Data Standards (CEDS) Data Warehouse. The tool is designed to be flexible, scalable, and adaptable to meet varying state data structures and quality requirements.

## Tool Structure
The core of the tool is a spreadsheet containing:
- An inventory of data quality validation rules
- Associated SQL code for each rule
- Documentation and implementation guidance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Access to the rule repository
- SQL environment where rules will be implemented
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax
- Familiarity with your state's data structure

### Using the Tool

#### Accessing the Rules
1. Open the spreadsheet
2. Use the built-in filters to sort and find relevant rules
3. Review the rule descriptions and requirements

#### Implementing Rules
1. Copy the SQL code from the selected rule
2. Run code against your database or add the code to your data quality rules engine
3. Test the modified query in your environment

#### Customizing Rules
- Adjust thresholds as needed for your state's requirements
- Modify date ranges to match your data periods
- Add additional conditions specific to your data structure

## Support and Resources
